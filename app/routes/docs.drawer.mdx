## Accessibility

The Drawer component is built on top of Base UI's Drawer, which provides:

- **ARIA attributes**: Proper roles and labels for screen readers
- **Keyboard navigation**: Dismisses on Escape key press
- **Focus management**: Focus is trapped within the drawer while open
- **Backdrop interaction**: Clicking the backdrop closes the drawer
